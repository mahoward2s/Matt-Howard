                    <p>I am a huge sports fan from Hockey to Wrestling and everything inbetween. One of my goals is to combine my love of sports and love of travel to see the St. Louis Blues play hockey in every NHL arena.  I’ve had the opportunity to visit 7 arenas so far.  As an avid traveler, I’ve had the opportunity to visit many states as well as the country of Spain.  Spain was an amazing experience that made me fall in love with the country.
